    <p>
        I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am advised by Dr. Majid Kazemian. I have also been fortunate to collaborate with researchers from the Olson Lab and Afzali Lab. My PhD research is supported by the Lynn Fellowship.

        <p>
           The goal of my research is to build toward a future where machine learning models can interpret biological systems with human-level intuition and mechanistic insight. I work toward this vision by developing scalable computational approaches for genetics, gene regulation, and single-cell biology. My research spans multiple fronts: large-scale analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data to derive interpretable gene programs; deep learning models for DNA and RNA sequence-to-function prediction; and methods that integrate genetic variation, regulatory signals, and ML-derived representations to uncover causal drivers of disease.
            (See my CV for the complete list of publications and ongoing projects.)

  I’m a Bay Area native who completed both my undergraduate and PhD studies in Computer Science at Purdue. Outside the lab, I enjoy baking endless varieties of bread and desserts, learning new dance moves (currently learning salsa), hiking new trails, and exploring unfamiliar cities — stay tuned!
